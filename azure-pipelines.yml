# azure-pipelines-frontend.yml
# This pipeline builds and deploys the React frontend to Azure Static Web Apps

# Trigger the pipeline on pushes to the main branch
trigger:
- main

# Use a Microsoft-hosted agent VM image (ubuntu-latest is recommended)
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# Define variables (optional for SWA name, but good practice)
variables:
  # --- Azure Static Web App Details ---
  # Replace these with your actual Static Web App name
  staticWebAppName: 'edusync-frontend' # <-- Replace with your SWA name if different
  # ------------------------------------

# Define the steps (tasks) for the pipeline
steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18.x' # Specify a suitable Node.js version (e.g., 18.x or 20.x)
  displayName: 'Install Node.js' # Display name for this step in the pipeline logs

- script: |
    npm install # Install project dependencies
    npm run build # Build the React application
  displayName: 'Build React App' # Display name for this step
  workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)' # Ensure commands run from the repo root

- task: AzureStaticWebApp@0
  inputs:
    # --- Paths based on your React project structure ---
    # app_location: Location of your application code within the repo relative to repo root
    app_location: '/'
    # output_location: Location of the build output (relative to app_location)
    # For create-react-app (react-scripts), the default build output folder is 'build'
    output_location: 'build'
    # ---------------------------------------------------

    # --- Azure Connection Details ---
    # The deployment token is retrieved from pipeline variables securely
    azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token) # This variable must be set securely!
    # You don't need to specify the Service Connection name here for the SWA task.
    # The SWA task uses a dedicated deployment token.
  displayName: 'Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps' # Display name for this step

# Important: Remember to set the 'deployment_token' variable securely in pipeline settings.
# This variable holds the deployment token copied from your Static Web App overview page in Azure Portal.
# To set this in Azure DevOps:
# 1. Go to Pipelines > Edit Pipeline > Variables
# 2. Add 'deployment_token' variable with the value from Azure Static Web App
# 3. Mark it as secret (check the lock icon)
